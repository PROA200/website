## Some Favorites

A collection of relatively niche writings that I've stumbled upon over the past year or so. These aren't really "recommendations"; it's more of a collection of things that I happened enjoy reading in the moment. (But I thought you might enjoy them anyway.)

### Prose

#### Essays

- There's a lot of good writing on [CJ Quines' blog](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/cjq/). If you're looking for something thoughtful, you might find ["The Long View"](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-long-view/) and ["You Can't Be Everything to Everyone"](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/you-cant-be-everything-to-everyone/) interesting.
- Something similar in style is ["Novelty"](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/novelty/) from Vincent Huang's blog on the same website.
- The essay ["How to Do What You Love"](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html) by Paul Graham.
- You should definitely read ["A Mathematician's Lament."](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) (Okay, I said that these weren't recommendations, but... you should read this.)
- ["Making energy too cheap to meter"](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/making-energy-too-cheap-to-meter) from Works In Progress, an argument for producing, well, more energy.

#### Books

- *The Spy and the Traitor* by Ben Macintyre is amazingly well-written.
- *The Dream Machine* by M. Mitchell Waldrop, a story of the personal computer (and a biography).
- I guess I kind of liked *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald. This was a required reading for school, sue me.
- *Projective Geometry* by T. Ewan Faulkner gives a rather unique perspective on projective geometry. It might be good bedtime reading, who knows. (It's definitely *not* an introduction to projective geometry.) 

#### Miscellaneous

- I'll probably regret putting this on here at some point, but [this tweet](https://twitter.com/collision/status/1529452415346302976)?

### Poetry

I'll admit it - I don't read a lot of poetry. I'll try to read more, I promise.

- I found ["I Saw in Louisiana A Live-Oak Growing"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45471/i-saw-in-louisiana-a-live-oak-growing) by Walt Whitman pretty thought-provoking to read.

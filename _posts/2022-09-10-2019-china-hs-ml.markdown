### Translated Problems from China High School Math League, First Round
*With major assistance from Google Translate.*

I've noticed that these aren't available on the AoPS contest collections (to my knowledge) and are only available on Chinese websites in Chinese, so I've copied them down in English here.

The first eight problems are each worth 8 points.

## 2019 Problems (Version A)
1. If it is known that the postiive real number $$a$$ satisfies $$a^a=(9a)^{8a}$$, find $$\log_a(3a)$$. 

2. If the difference between the largest element and the smallest element of the set of real numbers $$\{1,2,3,x\}$$ is equal to the sum of all elements of the set, then find the value of $$x$$.

3. In the Cartesian coordinate system, $$\vec{e}$$ is the unit vector. If the vector $$\vec a$$ satisfies the two conditions $$\vec a\cdot \vec e=2$$ and 

    $$\begin{aligned}\left\vert \vec a\right\vert ^2 \leq 5\left\vert \vec a + t\vec e\right\vert \end{aligned}$$

    for any real number $$t$$, find the range of possible values for $$\left\vert \vec a\right\vert $$.
	
4. Let $$A$$, $$B$$ be be the endpoints of the major axis of ellipse $$\Gamma$$, and let $$E$$, $$F$$ be the two foci. Given that $$\vert AB\vert =4$$, $$\vert AF\vert =2+\sqrt 3$$, and a point $$P$$ on $$\Gamma$$ satisfies $$\vert PE\vert \cdot \vert PF\vert =2$$, then find the area of $$\triangle PEF$$. 

5. Randomly select a number $$a$$ from $$1, 2, 3,\ldots,10$$, and randomly select a real number $$b$$ from $$-1,-2,-3,\ldots,-10$$. Find the probability that $$a^2+b$$ is divisible by $$3$$.

6. For any closed interval $$I$$, use $$M_I$$ to denote the maximum value of $$y=\sin x$$ on $$I$$. Given that the positive real number $$a$$ satisfies $$M_{\{0,a\}}=2M_{\{a,2a\}}$$, find the value of $$a$$.

7. As shown in the figure, a cross section of the cube $$ABCDEFGH$$ passes through the vertices $$A$$, $$C$$, and a point $$K$$ on $$EF$$, and the cube is divided into two parts with volume ratio $$3:1$$. Find the value of $$\frac{EK}{KF}$$.

8. Arrange the $$6$$ numbers $$2$$, $$0$$, $$1$$, $$9$$, $$20$$, and $$19$$ into a line in any order to form an $$8$$-digit number. How many different $$8$$ digit numbers can be created? (The first digit is not $$0$$.)

9. *(16 points)* In $$\triangle ABC$$, $$BC=a$$, $$CA=b$$, and $$AB=c$$. Given $$b$$ is the average of $$a$$ and $$c$$ and $$\sin A$$ is the average of $$\sin(B-A)$$ and $$\sin C$$, find the value of $$\cos B$$. 

10. *(20 points)* In the Cartesian coordinate system, the circle $$\Omega$$ and the parabola $$\Gamma : y^2=4x$$ have exactly one common point, and $$\Omega$$ is tangent to the $$x$$-axis at the $$F$$, the focus of $$\Gamma$$. Find the radius of $$\Omega$$. 

11. *(20 points)* Call a sequence of complex numbers $$\{z_n\}$$ *interesting* if $$\vert z_1\vert =1$$, and for any positive integer $$n$$, we have 

    $$\begin{aligned}4z_{n+1}^2+2z_nz_{n+1}+z_n^2=0.\end{aligned}$$

    Find the largest constant $$C$$ such that for all interesting sequences $$\{z_n\}$$ and any positive integer $$m$$, we have $$\vert z_1+z_2+\ldots + z_m\vert \geq C.$$

## 2019 Problems (Version B)

1. It is known that the largest element of the set of real numbers $$\{1,2,3,x\}$$ is equal to the sum of all elements of the set. Find $$x$$.

2. If the vector $$\vec a=(2^m,-1)$$ is perpendicular to the $$\vec b=(2^m-1, 2^{m+1})$$ where $$m$$ is a real number, then find $$\vert \vec a\vert $$. 

3. Let $$\alpha, \beta \in (0,\pi)$$ such that $$\cos \alpha, \cos \beta$$ are the two roots of the equation $$5x^2-3x-1$$. Find the value of $$\sin\alpha\sin\beta$$. 

4. Suppose the triangular pyramid $$PABC$$ satisfies $$PA=PB=3$$, $$AB=BC=CA=2$$. Find the maximum value of the volume of the triangular pyramid.

5. Arrange the $$5$$ numbers $$2, 0, 1, 9, 2019$$ in a row in any order to form an $$8$$-digit number. Given that the first digit is not $$0$$, find the number of different $$8$$-digit numbers that could be created.

6. Find the positive integer $$n>4$$ with the property that the coefficients of $$x^{n-4}$$ and $$xy$$ in expansion of $$(x+2\sqrt y -1)^n$$ are equal. 

7. In the Cartesian coordinate system, the circle with center $$(r+1,0)$$ and radius $$r$$ contains a point $$(a,b)$$ satisfying $$b^2\geq 4a$$. Find the smallest possible value of $$r$$.

8. Find the number of arithmetic sequences of positive integers $$\{a_n\}$$ such that $$a_1=2019$$, and, for any positive integer $$n$$, there exists a positive integer $$m$$ such that $$a_1+a_2+\cdots +a_n=a_m$$.

9. *(16 points)* In an ellipse $$\Gamma$$, $$F$$ a focus and $$A,B$$ are two of the vertices. Given that $$FA=3$$ and $$FB=2$$, find all possible values of $$AB$$.

10. *(20 points)*  $$a, b, c >1$$ satisfy 

    $$\begin{cases}\lg a + \log_b c = 3,\\
    \lg b + \log_a c = 4\end{cases}.$$
	
    Find the largest possible value of $$\lg a \cdot \lg c$$.
    
	*Note. Here, $$\lg$$ [denotes the base-10 logarithm.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lg)*

11. *(20 points)* Let the sequence of complex numbers $$\{z_n\}$$ satisfy $$\vert z_1\vert =n$$, and, for any positive $$n$$, $$4z_{n+1}^2 + 2z_nz_{n+1}+z_n^2 = 0.$$$ Prove that, for any positive integer $$m$$, we have 

    $$\vert z_1+z_2+\cdots + z_m\vert <\frac{2\sqrt 3}{3}.$$
